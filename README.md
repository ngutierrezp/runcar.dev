## 🚀 What is this?

**RunCar.dev** is a minimalist visual experiment that simulates a car driving down a road using ASCII art.  
Trees, lane markers, and rocks scroll by, giving the illusion of motion — all inside your terminal.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run It

No installation required!  
Simply open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl runcar.dev
```

> ⚠️ Make sure `curl` is installed. It's available by default on most Unix systems (Linux/macOS).  
> On Windows, you can use Git Bash or WSL.
